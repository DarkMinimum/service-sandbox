### Little Demo of the gRPC protocol

Repo consist of several separate applications:
* grpc-server
* rest-server
* graph-ql
* order-flow (details provided in separate [README.md](order-flow/README.md))

The idea is to understand and create MVP of gRPC protocol and compare it with REST.
Besides GraphQL is implemented for testing purposes.
